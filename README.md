### Status: in-service

This is a basic C# script that gets the status of all our servers.
I haven't commented all of the code for this resource just yet, however I'm not saying never.

I accept no liability for any results of using this script, including but not explicitly: emotional, security, physical, an apocalypse, the collapse of a government, the moon caving in on itself before it explodes, or you standing on a piece of lego.

NOTE: I'm still in the process of learning C#. Feel free to submit PRs if there're bits that could be improved.
